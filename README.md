 ## Work day Scheduler

This application is a simple work day scheduler created using moment.js. It consists of timeblocks from 9am to 5pm (the typical work day). The user types their schedule in the text area and clicks the save icon to save to the local storage. The timeblocks are colour coded in relation to the current date displayed at the top of the page. If the time block is the same hour as the current date hour i.e. present then the text area has a red background. If the current date has passed the hour displayed then the background is grey and if the timeblock is in the future the background is green. The HTML code has a meta tag that refreshes the page automatically every 30 seconds to ensure the displayed time is up to date.

I decided to generate the timeblocks in a for loop in the script file.
